- I am a Malaysian ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡¾ and I contributed substantially to NLP for South-East Asian (SEA) languages. For instance, I studied language-mixing behaviors for SEA languages ([EMNLP 2023 CALCS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13592), [EMNLP 2023 Findings](https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-emnlp.382/), [ACL 2023 Findings](https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-acl.185/)), contributed Malaysian cultural data to [SEACrowd](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10118) and [CVQA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05967), and co-hosted a tutorial for SEA NLP ([AACL 2023](https://aclanthology.org/2023.ijcnlp-tutorials.2/)).

- I went to [Minerva University](https://www.minerva.edu/) during my undergrad so I had the opportunity to travel and live in six different countries for at least four months: United States (San Francisco), South Korea (Seoul), India (Hyderabad), Germany (Berlin), Argentina (Buenos Aires), and United Kingdom (London).

- One of my biggest passion outside of work is dancing ðŸ•º, especially salsa and bachata. I also dance a bit of Lindy Hop, Argentine Tango and K-pop. I usually check out the dance scenes in the city when I travel to conferences â€“â€“â€“ if you also enjoy dancing, hmu we can check them out together.
