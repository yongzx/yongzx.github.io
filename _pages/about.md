I am a incoming fourth-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at [Brown University](https://cs.brown.edu/), advised by [Prof. Stephen Bach](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hs6pGXoAAAAJ&hl=en). Currently interning at Meta AI and will be back to my PhD program in Spring 2025. **<span style="color:brown;">My broad research goal is to develop AI that is safe and helpful for all users around the world.</span>**

**My current research focus is making multilingual LLMs safer**. My notable contributions to AI safety research:
- 🔎 I study/predict how safety alignment generalizes in the multilingual setting with mechanistic interpretability. I have investigated zero-shot cross-lingual generalization of toxicity reduction ([Findings of EMNLP 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16235)) and finetuning attacks ([preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18210)). 
- 🚨 I discovered that [low-resource languages can jailbreak GPT-4 (&#11089;Best Paper Award, NeurIPS 2023 Socially Responsible Language Modeling Workshop)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02446). This work was highlighted in the [International Scientific Report on the Safety of Advanced AI 2024](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/international-scientific-report-on-the-safety-of-advanced-ai), and it catalyzed the paradigm shift in industry AI labs towards multilingual red-teaming.
- ⛑️ I have done safety red-teaming research at frontier AI labs. 
  - **Meta AI (GenAI and FAIR)**: I worked on understanding finetuning attacks on Llama-3.1 and QWen-2 ([preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18210)). I also worked on red-teaming Massively Multilingual Speech models.
  - **Cohere For AI**: I worked on red-teaming Aya-101 [(&#11089;Best Paper Award, ACL 2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07827). 


**I also worked on making LLMs overcome language barriers** and support underrepresented languages. I've worked on adapting LLMs to low-resource languages [(ACL 2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09535), generating synthetic data for extremely low-resource languages [(Findings of EMNLP 2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14086), and developing multilingual AI models at [Meta AI (FAIR)](https://ai.meta.com/research/), [Cohere For AI (Aya)](https://cohere.com/research/aya), and [BigScience](https://bigscience.huggingface.co/).
  
**As a Malaysian, I also contributed to NLP for Southeast Asian (SEA) languages**. I've hosted [*ACL tutorials](https://aclanthology.org/2023.ijcnlp-tutorials.2/), helped curate SEACrowd data hub [(EMNLP 2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10118), and studied how well LLMs can handle SEA linguistic phenomenon, such as code-switching [(EMNLP 2023 CALCS Workshop)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13592), and understand culture in SEA region [(NeurIPS 2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05967).

**Other Misc Stuff:**
- If you want to chat or collaborate on any of the research directions above (or just talk about graduate schools), feel free to send an email to me: `contact [dot] yong @ brown [dot] edu`.
- My passion hobby is dancing, especially salsa and bachata. I also dance a bit of Lindy Hop, Argentine Tango and K-pop. <br>I usually check out the dance scenes in the city when I travel to conferences ––– if you also enjoy dancing, hmu we can check them out together.
- I went to [Minerva University](https://www.minerva.edu/) during undergrad so I had the opportunity to travel and live in six different cities around the world: 🇺🇸 San Francisco, 🇰🇷 Seoul, 🇮🇳 Hyderabad, 🇩🇪 Berlin, 🇦🇷 Buenos Aires and 🇬🇧 London.
