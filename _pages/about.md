I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Brown University, advised by [Prof. Stephen Bach](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hs6pGXoAAAAJ&hl=en). I am fortunate to have worked with researchers at <u>Meta GenAI Safety Alignment</u> (with [Jianfeng Chi](https://jfchi.github.io/)), <u>Meta AI FAIR</u> (with [Jean Maillard](https://maillard.it/) and [Michael Auli](https://michaelauli.github.io/)), and <u>Cohere Labs</u> (with [Julia Kreutzer](https://juliakreutzer.github.io/), [Beyza Ermis](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=v2cMiCAAAAAJ&hl=en), [Marzieh Fadaee](https://marziehf.github.io/), and [Sara Hooker](https://www.sarahooker.me/)). 

These days, my current focus is on **scaling reasoning compute**. My most recent work shows that test-time scaling of English models can unlock crosslingual reasoning through "quote-and-think" pattern [(preprint)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05408). More work to come soon :)

I also work on **safety alignment**. I was the first to discover that low-resource languages can <u>jailbreak</u> GPT-4 [(&#11089;Best Paper Award, NeurIPS 2023 Socially Responsible Language Modeling Workshop)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02446), This work pioneered multilingual red-teaming and was highlighted in the [first International Scientific Report on the Safety of Advanced AI (2024)](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/international-scientific-report-on-the-safety-of-advanced-ai). It was also featured on [New Scientist](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2398656-gpt-4-gave-advice-on-planning-terrorist-attacks-when-asked-in-zulu/), [Montreal AI Ethics Institute](https://montrealethics.ai/low-resource-languages-jailbreak-gpt-4/), [ZDNET](https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-safety-of-openais-gpt-4-is-lost-in-translation/), etc. Besides, I have worked on <u>interpretability study</u> to explain crosslingual transfer of alignment training [(EMNLP 2024 Findings)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16235) and fine-tuning attacks [(NAACL 2025 Findings)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18210). I also have experience <u>red-teaming</u> frontier LLMs such as [Aya model (Cohere Labs)](https://cohere.com/research/aya). 

I've dedicated considerable amount of time working on **multilingual NLP** to create LLMs that are helpful and safe for everyone in the world. I am a major contributor to <u>frontier open-sourced multilingual LLMs</u> such as Aya models [(&#11089;Best Paper Award, ACL 2024 â€“ co-first author)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07827) and [mT0/BLOOMZ (ACL 2023)](https://aclanthology.org/2023.acl-long.891.pdf). I have also worked on <u>low-resource NLP</u>, such as language adaptation [(ACL 2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09535) and synthetic data generation [(EMNLP 2024 Findings)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14086). I have also worked with <u>speech technology</u>, particularly on understanding accent bias in ASR (INTERSPEECH 2025). Besides, as a Malaysian, I have contributed to NLP for Southeast Asian (SEA) languages. I've co-hosted [*ACL tutorial (2023)](https://aclanthology.org/2023.ijcnlp-tutorials.2/), helped curate SEACrowd data hub [(EMNLP 2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10118), and studied how well LLMs can handle SEA linguistic phenomenon, such as code-switching [(EMNLP 2023 CALCS Workshop)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13592), and understand culture in SEA region [(NeurIPS 2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05967).

Other Misc Stuff:
- I went to [Minerva University](https://www.minerva.edu/) for my undergrad so I had the opportunity to travel and live in six different cities (for at least 4 months in each city) around the world: ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ San Francisco, ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡· Seoul, ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ Hyderabad, ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª Berlin, ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡· Buenos Aires and ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ London. 
- My passion hobby is dancing ðŸ•º, especially salsa and bachata. I also dance a bit of Lindy Hop, Argentine Tango and K-pop. <br>I usually check out the dance scenes in the city when I travel to conferences â€“â€“â€“ if you also enjoy dancing, hmu we can check them out together.
