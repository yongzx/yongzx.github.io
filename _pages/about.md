I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Brown University, advised by [Prof. Stephen Bach](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hs6pGXoAAAAJ&hl=en). I am also fortunate to have done research at [Meta (FAIR and GenAI Safety Alignment)](https://ai.meta.com/research/), [Cohere For AI](https://cohere.com/research/aya), and [BigScience](https://bigscience.huggingface.co/). My broad research vision is to develop LLMs that are safe and helpful for everyone.

My current focus is on **test-time scaling and reasoning language models**. My most recent work is about how scaling up thinking tokens can improve crosslingual reasoning performance.

I work on **safety alignment** after discovering that low-resource languages can jailbreak GPT-4 [(&#11089;Best Paper Award, NeurIPS 2023 Socially Responsible Language Modeling Workshop)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02446). This work pioneered multilingual red-teaming and was highlighted in the [International Scientific Report on the Safety of Advanced AI 2024](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/international-scientific-report-on-the-safety-of-advanced-ai). I also study cross-lingual generalization of both safety training [(EMNLP 2024 Findings)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16235) and fine-tuning attacks [(NAACL 2025 Findings)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18210). I also have industry experience red-teaming for frontier multilingual LLMs such as Aya [(&#11089;Best Paper Award, ACL 2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07827).

I also work on developing **multilingual LLMs**, making them both safer and more helpful. I've helped develop [Aya model (Cohere For AI)](https://cohere.com/research/aya) and [T0 as well as BLOOM (BigScience)](https://bigscience.huggingface.co/). I also worked on low-resource NLP such as adapting LLMs to low-resource languages [(ACL 2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09535), generating synthetic data for extremely low-resource languages [(EMNLP 2024 Findings)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14086), and mitigating bias against out-of-distribution accents in speech models (to appear).

<!-- - **Meta AI (FAIR)**: I study how to collect data to make Massively Multilingual Speech models robust to accents.
- **Cohere For AI**: In addition to safety red-teaming the [Aya model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07827), I also worked as a language ambassador for the Malay language for the [Aya dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06619).
- **BigScience**: I led the language adaptation project for BLOOM, known as [BLOOM+1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09535). I also helped developed [T0](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08207), [BLOOM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05100), and [mT0/BLOOMZ](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01786).  -->
  
As a Malaysian, I also contributed to NLP for Southeast Asian (SEA) languages. I've hosted [*ACL tutorials](https://aclanthology.org/2023.ijcnlp-tutorials.2/), helped curate SEACrowd data hub [(EMNLP 2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10118), and studied how well LLMs can handle SEA linguistic phenomenon, such as code-switching [(EMNLP 2023 CALCS Workshop)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13592), and understand culture in SEA region [(NeurIPS 2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05967).

Other Misc Stuff:
- I went to [Minerva University](https://www.minerva.edu/) for my undergrad so I had the opportunity to travel and live in six different cities (for at least 4 months in each city) around the world: ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ San Francisco, ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡· Seoul, ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ Hyderabad, ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª Berlin, ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡· Buenos Aires and ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ London. 
- My passion hobby is dancing ðŸ•º, especially salsa and bachata. I also dance a bit of Lindy Hop, Argentine Tango and K-pop. <br>I usually check out the dance scenes in the city when I travel to conferences â€“â€“â€“ if you also enjoy dancing, hmu we can check them out together.
