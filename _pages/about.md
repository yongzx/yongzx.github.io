I am a rising fourth-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Brown University, advised by [Prof. Stephen Bach](https://cs.brown.edu/people/sbach/). I'm fortunate to have collaborated with [Cohere For AI](https://cohere.com/research) and [Meta AI (FAIR)](https://ai.meta.com/).

**Lately, I work on making multilingual LLMs safe.** 
- I've pioneered [translation-based jailbreaking (NeurIPS 2023 Socially Responsible Language Modeling Workshop, &#11089;Best Paper Award)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02446) by discovering that GPT-4 can be jailbroken when malicious instructions are translated into low-resource languages. Our work was cited in the [International Scientific Report on the Safety of Advanced AI 2024](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/international-scientific-report-on-the-safety-of-advanced-ai) by the UK Government to highlight the need for multilingual red-teaming.
- I collaborated with Cohere For AI to perform [multilingual safety red-teaming team for Aya-101 (ACL 2024, &#11089;Best Paper Award)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07827), which is the state-of-the-art LLM that follows instructions in 101 languages.
- I researched cross-lingual transfer of safety knowledge, such as [toxicity (Findings of EMNLP 2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16235) and harmful-finetuning (coming soon).

I also dedicate efforts to **create intelligent systems that overcome language barriers** and serve all users around the world, including those who speak underrepresented languages, through model-centric and data-centric solutions.
- I participated in world-wide collaborations for building frontier multilingual LLMs:
  - **[Cohere For AI](https://cohere.com/research/aya)**: I served as [language ambassador](https://cohere.com/research/aya-contributors-test) who coordinate the data collection efforts for Malay language in [Aya dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06619). In addition, I also helped [safety red-teaming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07827) for Aya models.
  - **[BigScience](https://bigscience.huggingface.co/)**: I contributed to [BLOOM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05100), [T0](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08207) and [mT0/BLOOMZ](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01786). In addition, I led the research efforts for [adapting BLOOM to unseen languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09535).
- I researched how to finetune multilingual LLMs, such as [BLOOM+1 (ACL 2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09535), to adapt to low-resource languages unseen during pretraining.
- I proposed novel methods to generate synthetic training data for underrepresented languages. For the very first time, synthetic data generated by our [LexC-Gen (Findings of EMNLP 2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14086) can match the performance of manually collected training data for very low-resource languages in Indonesia and Africa.

As a Malaysian, I also contributed to **NLP for Southeast Asian (SEA) languages** outside my PhD. I've hosted [*ACL tutorials](https://aclanthology.org/2023.ijcnlp-tutorials.2/), helped curate [SEACrowd data hub (EMNLP 2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10118), and studied how well LLMs can handle SEA linguistic phenomenon such as [code-switching (EMNLP 2023 CALCS Workshop)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13592) and understand [SEA culture (NeurIPS 2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05967).

**Other Misc Stuff:**
- I enjoy research collaborations. If you want to chat or collaborate, you can reach me here: `contact [dot] yong @ brown [dot] edu`. 
- I love partner dancing, and I usually check out the dance scenes in the city when I travel to conferences. <br>I'd consider myself a good salsa dancer, and I'm currently learning modern bachata. I also dance Lindy Hop, Argentine Tango, and (very little bit of) K-pop.
- I went to [Minerva University](https://www.minerva.edu/) during undergrad so I had the opportunity to travel and live in six different cities around the world: San Francisco, Seoul, Hyderabad, Berlin Buenos Aires and London.
