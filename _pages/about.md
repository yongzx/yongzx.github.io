I am a incoming fourth-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at [Brown University](https://cs.brown.edu/), advised by [Prof. Stephen Bach](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hs6pGXoAAAAJ&hl=en). I am fortunate to have done research at [Meta AI FAIR](https://ai.meta.com/research/), [Meta GenAI Trust](https://ai.meta.com/research/), [Cohere For AI (Aya)](https://cohere.com/research/aya), and [BigScience](https://bigscience.huggingface.co/).

⛑️ **My current research focus is to make LLMs safe for all users around the world**. I study cross-lingual LLM safety alignment. Below are my featured work:
- [<span style="color:brown; font-weight: bold;">Low-resource languages can jailbreak GPT-4</span> (&#11089;Best Paper Award, NeurIPS 2023 Socially Responsible Language Modeling Workshop)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02446) &rarr; this work established the need for multilingual red-teaming for frontier LLMs and was highlighted in the [International Scientific Report on the Safety of Advanced AI 2024](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/international-scientific-report-on-the-safety-of-advanced-ai).
- **Mechanistic understanding of cross-lingual safety generalization** for toxicity reduction ([Findings of EMNLP 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16235)) and finetuning attacks ([preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18210)).
- **Safety red-teaming at frontier AI labs**: Aya @ Cohere For AI [(&#11089;Best Paper Award, ACL 2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07827), Massively Multilingual Speech (MMS) @ Meta FAIR.

⭐️ I also worked on making LLMs helpful for all users through overcoming language barriers and supporting underrepresented languages. I've worked on adapting LLMs to low-resource languages [(ACL 2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09535), generating synthetic data for extremely low-resource languages [(Findings of EMNLP 2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14086), and developing massively multilingual models at frontier AI groups such as [Meta AI FAIR (MMS model)](https://ai.meta.com/research/), [Cohere For AI (Aya model)](https://cohere.com/research/aya) and [BigScience (T0, BLOOM, mT0/BLOOMZ, BLOOM+1)](https://bigscience.huggingface.co/).

<!-- - **Meta AI (FAIR)**: I study how to collect data to make Massively Multilingual Speech models robust to accents.
- **Cohere For AI**: In addition to safety red-teaming the [Aya model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07827), I also worked as a language ambassador for the Malay language for the [Aya dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06619).
- **BigScience**: I led the language adaptation project for BLOOM, known as [BLOOM+1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09535). I also helped developed [T0](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08207), [BLOOM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05100), and [mT0/BLOOMZ](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01786).  -->
  
🇲🇾 As a Malaysian, I also contributed to NLP for Southeast Asian (SEA) languages. I've hosted [*ACL tutorials](https://aclanthology.org/2023.ijcnlp-tutorials.2/), helped curate SEACrowd data hub [(EMNLP 2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10118), and studied how well LLMs can handle SEA linguistic phenomenon, such as code-switching [(EMNLP 2023 CALCS Workshop)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13592), and understand culture in SEA region [(NeurIPS 2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05967).

**Other Misc Stuff:**
- If you want to chat or collaborate on any of the research directions above (or just talk about graduate schools), feel free to send an email to me: `contact [dot] yong @ brown [dot] edu`.
- My passion hobby is dancing, especially salsa and bachata. I also dance a bit of Lindy Hop, Argentine Tango and K-pop. <br>I usually check out the dance scenes in the city when I travel to conferences ––– if you also enjoy dancing, hmu we can check them out together.
- I went to [Minerva University](https://www.minerva.edu/) during undergrad so I had the opportunity to travel and live in six different cities around the world: 🇺🇸 San Francisco, 🇰🇷 Seoul, 🇮🇳 Hyderabad, 🇩🇪 Berlin, 🇦🇷 Buenos Aires and 🇬🇧 London.
