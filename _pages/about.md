I am a rising fourth-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Brown University, advised by [Prof. Stephen Bach](https://cs.brown.edu/people/sbach/). I'm fortunate to have collaborated with [Cohere For AI](https://cohere.com/research) and [Meta AI (FAIR)](https://ai.meta.com/).

**I work on making multilingual LLMs safe and inclusive.** In particular, I am interested in creating intelligent systems that can serve global users in a safe and responsible manner, covering up to 7000+ languages. So far, I work on these following directions:

1. **ensuring safe multilingual LLMs**
  - ***cross-lingual jailbreaking***: I discovered that [GPT-4 can be jailbroken when malicious instructions are translated into low-resource languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02446). <br>Our work won the *best paper award* in NeurIPS 2023 Socially Responsible Language Modeling workshop and was cited in the [International Scientific Report on the Safety of Advanced AI](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/international-scientific-report-on-the-safety-of-advanced-ai) by the UK Government to highlight the need for multilingual red-teaming.
  - ***multilingual red-teaming***: I part of the safety red-teaming team for [Aya-101](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07827) (state-of-the-art LLM that follows instructions in 101 languages) released by Cohere For AI.
  - ***cross-lingual safety transfer***: I researched how safety knowledge, such as [detoxification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16235) and harmful-finetuning, can transfer across languages in LLMs.


2. **serving thousands of underrepresented languages**
  - ***[BLOOM+1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09535)***: language adaptation research that studies how to adapt LLMs to low-resource languages.
  - ***[LexC-Gen](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14086)***: synthetic data generation method that allows LLMs to generate training data in languages not covered by LLMs. This the *first time* where synthetic data can match manually collected data in low-resource languages.

3. **world-wide open-source collaborations for frontier multilingual LLMs**.
  - ***[Cohere For AI](https://cohere.com/research/aya)***: I served as [language ambassador](https://cohere.com/research/aya-contributors-test) who coordinate the data collection efforts for Malay language in [Aya dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06619). In addition, I also helped [safety red-teaming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07827) for Aya models.
  - ***[BigScience](https://bigscience.huggingface.co/)***: I contributed to [BLOOM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05100), [T0](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08207) and [mT0/BLOOMZ](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01786). In addition, I led the research efforts for [adapting BLOOM to unseen languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09535).

As a Malaysian, I also contribute to open-source NLP development in Southeast Asia region. I've hosted [*ACL tutorials](https://aclanthology.org/2023.ijcnlp-tutorials.2/) on such topic, helped curate [SEACrowd data hub](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10118), and studied how well LLMs handle common SEA linguistic phenomena such as [code-switching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13592).

**Other Misc Stuff:**
- I love research collaborations. If you want to chat or collaborate, you can reach me here: `contact [dot] yong @ brown [dot] edu`. 
- I love dancing, and I usually check out the dance scene when I attend conferences. <br>I'd consider myself a good salsa dancer, and I'm currently learning modern bachata. I also dance Lindy Hop, Argentine Tango, and (very little bit of) K-pop.
- Went to [Minerva University](https://www.minerva.edu/) so I had the opportunity to live in six different coutries (USA, UK, South Korea, India, Argentina, and Germany) during my undergraduate years.
