I am a rising fourth-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Brown University. I am fortunate to be advised by <span style="color: black !important; ">[Prof. Stephen Bach](https://cs.brown.edu/people/sbach/)</span>. I work on making AI **safe and inclusive**. 

**Industry Experience:** Currently, I am a research scientist intern at Meta AI (FAIR) under the supervision of [Jean Maillard](https://maillard.it/) and [Michael Auli](https://michaelauli.github.io/), working on Responsible AI research for multilingual speech models. Previously, I worked on multilingual safety at Cohere For AI [(Aya)](https://cohere.com/research/aya) and low-resource language adapation at [BigScience](https://bigscience.huggingface.co/). 

**Research Interests:** I think broadly about how we can create intelligent systems that are accessible to global users without causing harm. So far, I work along these directions:
1. ***multilingual safety*** – My [discovery that GPT-4 can be jailbroken by low-resource languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02446) highlights the need for multilingual red-teaming. I also study how safety knowledge (e.g., [detoxification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16235)) can transfer cross-lingually. In addition, I collaborate with frontier labs. I worked on [multilingual red-teaming for Aya-101](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07827) at Cohere For AI, and now I work on safety for multilingual speech models at Meta AI.

2. ***building open-source multilingual LLMs*** – I have been a major contributor to the open-source multilingual LLMs ecosystem. For instance, I served as [Aya Malay language ambassador](https://cohere.com/research/aya-contributors-test) in addition to [safety red-teaming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07827) for Aya models at [Cohere For AI](https://cohere.com/research). I also contributed to [BLOOM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05100), [T0](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08207) and [mT0/BLOOMZ](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01786) at [BigScience](https://bigscience.huggingface.co/). In addition, I led the research for [adapting BLOOM to unseen languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09535) at BigScience.

3. ***enabling AI to serve underrepresented populations*** – To bridge the language gap in AI, I work on model-centric ([language adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09535)) and data-centric ([synthetic data generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14086)) solutions. My [most recent work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14086) uses lexicons to generate synthetic data that can match against human-collected data *for the very first time in low-resource languages*. I also dedicate NLP efforts for *South-East-Asian (SEA) languages*. I helped curate [SEACrowd data hub](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10118) and evaluate how well LLMs handle common SEA linguistic phenomena such as [code-switching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13592).

I love collaborations. If you want to chat or collaborate, you can reach me here: `contact [dot] yong @ brown [dot] edu`. I also occasionally write on my [blog](https://yongzx.github.io/blog).
